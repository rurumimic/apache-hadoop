## SSH

Now check that you can ssh to the localhost without a passphrase:

```bash
ssh localhost
```

If you cannot ssh to localhost without a passphrase like  
`Permission denied (publickey,gssapi-keyex,gssapi-with-mic)`

execute the following commands:

```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -P '' -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa;
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys;
chmod 0600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys;
```
